### [Open Therapist Directory]

If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here

### Pitch

This project will provide a place for therapists and clients to connect for no charge to either the client or the therapist, as well as providing numerous resources for the low-income and homeless populations.

### Description

Provides clients and therapists with a platform to connect.  Also provides resources for homeless/low income populations to find mental health resources.  Possibly connects homeless population to therapists willing to donate their time for pro-bono work.  Perhaps it will also provide a google map with locations marked for therapists around a given location.

### Target Audience

Low-income/Homeless population.
Therapists.
General population looking for mental health assistance.

### Integrations

* What OAuth provider makes sense for this audience? Facebook
* What Data.gov data or API will you use?  I will definitely use the treatment facility locator.  I would also like to use some of the stats to create interesting data sets if time permits.

My other ideas are just offshoots of this project and/or just trimming it down some.  I would love to work on something related to this, and I am open to suggestions, but I feel passionate about the pain points in the mental health field and feel this could contribute to the community.  As such, I have put up a placeholder rails project on a digital ocean droplet and registered the domain name: [Open Therapist Directory](http://www.opentherapistdirectory.com/)
